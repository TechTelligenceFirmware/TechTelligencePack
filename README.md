This software was designed for the people who work smarter, not harder.  Our software is not a firmware, it is a package that you install along side the Unleashed Firmware With our software you can skip all of the sketchy script downloads, and cut straight to the chase.  The Techtellignce package comes with every script you will ever need, including the popular, Tesla Charger Opener, Customer Assistance, cool NFC and IR tricks, and many more.  Why waste your time downloading hundreds of scripts, when we have already done it for you.
